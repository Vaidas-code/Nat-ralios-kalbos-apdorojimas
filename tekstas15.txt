A decimal number is defined as a number which is written in the decimal notation where each digit represents the different powers of 10. For instance, 20.456, 5.06, 0.0001 are examples of decimal numbers. Decimals are those in which one or more digits repeat again and again, for example, 1/3 = 0.3333333. Rounding: 14.735 is halfway between 14.73 and 14.74, so it is rounded up: 14.735 rounded to 2 decimal places is 14.74.
